# The Commute From Hell

And to think it started pleasantly.

I finished hiking, made it back to my car, and punched home into the GPS.

The trailhead must've been halfway between the office and my apartment.
I was much closer than I expected; the GPS suggested there were only 15 short
minutes of fast-paced Utah highway between my dusty skin and a warm shower.

It was going to take me much longer than 15 minutes to make it home.

You wouldn't have expected it, when I was nearing the last exit with 3 minutes left on my phone's GPS readout.

But I must've missed the exit it wanted me to take.
We'll never know for sure.
My phone died before it could read it out to me.

## Bad News

No harm, no foul.
It was my second day at work at work after all,
my third or fourth time driving from work home.
I should've been able to identify a viable exit.

I even thought I had? But by then it was too late, I was flying past it in an entourage of traffic hurtling me forward at an astonishingly legal 70 miles per hour. (Not to suggest that Utah drivers are perturbed by such arcane technicalities as legal speed limits).

I patiently waited for another exit I might recognize, but the highway began to curve out of the valley.

I may not have known how to get home, but I knew this route wasn't taking me there.

Panicking, I took the next exit. (I might've swerved across a couple empty lanes.)

Almost as soon as I did so, Salt Lake City's open highways and distant high rises crumpled around me, forming a writhing mass of industrial smoke stacks. Calmer now, I meandered down markingless roads hemmed in by decrepit vehicles, punctuated by railroad tracks, and interrupted by haphazardly strewn about shipping containers.

I knew my apartment was south of the city center. I knew I had to be north of the city center right now.

All I had to do, then, was crawl south, toward the city center. And sure enough, I found them. Even if I hadn't
known their general direction, all I had to do was make it to somewhere with a clear view of the horizon.

It's pretty hard to miss the really tall buildings.

By this point, I was starving.

I was fairly certain my apartment was nestled in the fragrant armpit between the city center and that very same northbound highway, but I couldn't be too sure; I had only lived there for a couple days, after all.

The problem with trying to crawl parallel to a major highway like that is that every intersection is simply begging you to get on the highway.

It's painfully easy to find yourself, repeatedly, in right-only lanes when all you want to do is go straight.

Pressed into such a difficult situation, you're left with very few options.

One of them is simply to wait for all of the cars on your left to make their turn, then, illegally but perhaps still safely, go straight. (Make sure to mentally apologize to the poor sods behind you).

However, if you're starving to death and panicky, you might shoot forward in the blind hope that the car to your left is actually just going straight after all, and then punch the break when you realize that they are, in fact, turning, right in front of you, begging you to ram your car into their passenger door.

If you were hungry enough, panicked enough by the mounting darkness, you might inevitably find yourself on a highway on ramp despite your mounting hope against hope that your home was only one block further south.

You might even get confused by "WRONG WAY" signs _in the other lane_ and then make an extremely dangerous and illegal maneuver where you turn around on the on ramp and go back the way you came. But you'd have to be out of your mind to do that, right?

## Desperate measures

Who's to say what might've happened? I was so hungry and so stressed out... that it's all a blur anyway. All I can say with confidence is that eventually, I decided that for my own safety -- and the safety of everyone else on the road -- I just needed to stop driving. And buy a damn phone charger for my car.

I pulled into a gas station. There was a homeless man out front I was fairly certain I had seen screaming "FUCK YOU, BILLY!" outside of a Target that was within walking distance of my apartment. This was good news! Perhaps I was closer to home than I thought.

It was all academic, really. Once I bought a phone charger in here, I'd be able to make my way home no matter how far away it was. I'd know which way to go, instead of relying on my vaguely faulty sense of direction.

As I approached the building, a clean, rotund man simply handed the homeless man a box of donuts.

Right in front of me.

At this point in time, I'm not certain I needed the donuts more than the homeless man.
However, salivating in front of that gas station, there wasn't a single doubt in my mind.

I suppose he should consider himself fortunate that at that point in time,
simply buying a Cliff Bar and a phone charger seemed like less of a hassle than wresting the box of donuts out of his hands.

Inside of the gas station, the homeless man made a scene of opening the box of donuts with fingers stained black with grime and a cigarette hanging out of his mouth.

A rent-a-cop made me feel measurably more safe as he approached the homeless man and reminded him that he couldn't smoke that inside of the gas station.

I completed my desperate transaction and began making it back to my car.
As I passed the rent-a-cop, who was now standing at something like attention outside of the gas station,
I turned to him and remarked that people were crazy.

He laughed, and told me to have a nice night.

I immediately plugged in my phone and began devouring ... but when I next looked up,
more homeless-looking people had coalesced outside of the gas station.

The rent-a-cop laughed with them and lit a long brown cigarillo.

Whatever last bastion of safety he represented, I decided, was broken.

I put my car into reverse and pulled out of the gas station.

Looking only to find anywhere else to park, anywhere but that increasingly crowded gas station, I impulsively took a left.

Suddenly, I realized, I knew exactly where I was. A park within walking distance of my apartment.

Of course, now that I had bought the phone charger, I wouldn't need it.

Consciously deciding I was too exhausted for irony, I stifled a laugh.

## A warm welcome

I cruised back home at a leisurely pace and parked where I had been parking my car the last couple of days.

Right before I turned off my car, a white sedan pulled out of the gated enclosure of a nearby mechanic's.

He stopped right outside of the enclosure and made a hostile form of eye contact with,
piercing right through his open window on through my windshield.

He whipped out his phone and began chanting exultantly, "the fucking parking guy, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. right-in-fucking-front of me!"

It took me three shaky tries to park again across the street.
